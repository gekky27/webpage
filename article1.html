     <div class="news-content">
    <p>Hi, I'm Wulan Sanistia! Joining Kanaditya was honestly one of the best and most exciting things I've done in high school. I'd never joined a community like this before. And it turns out that there are so many kind, happy, and super passionate people here. What made it even cooler was that even though our activities took place at TPS Monang-maning, which is actually a garbage dump, everyone stayed positive, energetic, and friendly.</p>

    <p>One of my favorite moments there was when we made crafts together - like pipe cleaner flowers, key chains, necklaces, and other fun things. The kids were so excited! Even though the place wasn't fancy at all, they didn't care about gadgets, and everyone stayed focused, listened carefully, and had fun creating. It felt good to be a part of something like that.</p>

    <p>Then came a moment I'll never forget. On February 23, 2025, we had this special event at the RMCH halfway house where we made steamed cakes with some amazing kids with Down syndrome. I remember hearing about the event and immediately asking my friend Hasya to join me. It was a little far in Renon, traffic was a mess, and we even got a little lost, but our excitement made it all worth it. When the kids arrived, their smiles lit up the room.</p>

    <p>The best part was when we started mixing colorful cake dough. Some kids were super energetic, some were a little quiet, but we made sure to include everyone. Hasya and I actually love hanging out with little kids, so it was really fun for us too. The shapes were adorable - there were turtles, crabs, shells and more. The cakes came out so colorful and pretty, and they tasted great too! Afterwards, we cleaned up the tools and took group pictures. And honestly, the way the kids posed was so funny and unique, it made the whole day even more memorable.</p>

    <p>It was a simple day - cooking, laughing, cleaning up, and taking pictures - but those little moments left a huge impact on me. That day changed the way I look at things. I learned that Down syndrome is not something to be pitied - it's just a condition that makes them special in their own way. They deserve the same happiness, love and opportunities as everyone else. It reminded me how beautiful life is when we care for each other, and how happiness can come from the simplest things when shared with good people. And as Maya Angelou once said, "We are more alike, my friends, than we are unlike." I swear, after living that moment, those words didn't just sound like a quote - they became something I truly felt in my heart.</p>

    <p>I'm truly grateful to Kanaditya for opening a space where we can learn together, support each other, and embrace children with special needs. I am proud to be a part of this generation of Kanaditya volunteers. I hope that this community will continue to grow and improve, and that more people will see Kanaditya as a child-friendly, kind-hearted community that has a positive impact on society.</p>
